Cascading:
When we perform some action on the target entity, the same action will be applied to the associated entity.

JPA Cascade types
ALL - propagates all operations — including Hibernate-specific ones — from a parent to a child entity.
PERSIST - propagates the persist operation from a parent to a child entity.
When we save the person entity, the address entity will also get saved.
MERGE - The merge operation copies the state of the given object onto the persistent object with the same identifier.
propagates the merge operation from a parent to a child entity.
REMOVE - propagates the remove operation from parent to child entity.
REFRESH - , the child entity also gets reloaded from the database whenever the parent entity is refreshed.
DETACH - The detach operation removes the entity from the persistent context.
When we use CascadeType.DETACH, the child entity will also get removed from the persistent context.

Hibernate Cascade types
REPLICATE - the replicate operation is used when we have more than one data source and we want the data in sync.
With CascadeType.REPLICATE, a sync operation also propagates to child entities whenever performed on the parent entity.
SAVE_UPDATE - propagates the same operation to the associated child entity
LOCK -CascadeType.LOCK reattaches the entity and its associated child entity with the persistent context again.

FetchType.LAZY: It fetches the child entities lazily, that is, at the time of fetching parent entity it 
just fetches proxy (created by cglib or any other utility) of the child entities and when you access any property 
of child entity then it is actually fetched by hibernate.

FetchType.EAGER: it fetches the child entities along with parent.
